It is a simple project to show bulb-on,bulb-off indications using images, especially when you click-on the respective buttons

what to do : In html we just create bulb-on and bulb-off buttons and add an onclick() for the buttons to something happen by clicking the buttons.And in script we create a variable and get the instance from html(get element by id ) and just write in the inner html with bulb-on and bulb-off images.

How it works : when you click-on the bulb-on button it will show the bulb-on image on template,similarly when you click-on the bulb-off button it will show the bulb-off image on template.
